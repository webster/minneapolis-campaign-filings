minneapolis-campaign-filings
============================

This repository contains campaign finance filings as filed with Hennepin County Taxpayer Services for individuals running for elected office in Minneapolis, which I'm working on organizing by office, date, flipping pages as necessary, and OCRing to make it a little more machine-readable.  This does not contain every single filing, and the original filings are accessible (but difficult to navigate) at http://www16.co.hennepin.mn.us/cfrs/welcome.do.

The original campaign filings within this repository are public domain government filings.
