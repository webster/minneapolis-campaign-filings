Minneapolis Campaign Finance Filings
====================================

This repository contains campaign finance filings as filed with Hennepin County Taxpayer Services for individuals running for elected office in the City of Minneapolis, organized by office and date. Candidates are included if they have an open committee, which includes candidates who have not publicly announced their candidancy.

This is not machine-readable data. Hennepin County provides fillable PDFs and Microsoft Word .DOC templates for candidates to print and file in-person or via mail, so nothing is electronic at all. Many candidate filings are actually hand-written. Documents here have had pages rotated to correct orientation as necessary, and OCR'd to make some information a bit more readable.

There are a number of laws in Minnesota Statutes on campaign finance reporting just for jurisdictions of a certain size.  Minn. Stat. ยง 383B.043, subd. 2, requires that no contributions be accepted while a treasurer is vacant and no anonymous contributions greater than $20 be accepted (excess amounts must be forwarded to the State for deposit to the general fund).

Pursuant to Minn. Stat. ยง 383B.045, et seq., any candidate which receives contributions or spends greater than $100 must register as a principal campaign committee within 14 days of such an expenditure or contribution.  Committees are required to register with and publicly report:

- the name and address of the political committee, political fund, or principal campaign committee;
- the name and address of the chair, the treasurer, and any deputy treasurers;
- the name and address of the depository used by the committee or fund;
- the name and address of any supporting association of a political fund; and
- a statement as to whether the committee is a principal campaign committee.

The original filings are accessible (but difficult to navigate) at http://www16.co.hennepin.mn.us/cfrs/welcome.do.

Nothing stated herein is legal advice.
